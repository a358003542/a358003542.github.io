> 人们想要，更多还有更多 <br />
去站在世界之巅 <br />
他们彼此比较<br />
看谁最聪明跑的更快 <br />
看谁最坚韧爬的更高 <br />
看谁最有权势屹立不倒 <br />

> 时间衰减，少之又少 <br />
让事情变得不是那么有意义 <br />
欲望相互竞争 <br />
所以那最聪明的满足于宇宙万物 <br />
所以那坚韧的满足于自我 <br />
而那最有权势的当属上帝 <br />
他满足于一切 <br />

> People want, more and more, <br />
to stand on top of the world. <br />
They compete with each other. <br />
which smart man goes faster. <br />
which tough man climes higher. <br />
which powerful man stays stronger. <br />

> Time declines, less and less, <br />
making everything a bit meaningless. <br />
Desires compete with each other. <br />
so the smartest man is satisfied with the universe. <br />
so the toughest man is satisfied with himself. <br />
and the most powerful man is God. <br />
He is satisfied with everything. <br />
