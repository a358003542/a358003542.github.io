## step one: find what it is

The world everything is data as input to the AGI brain, here the main question alway is to find out who or what it is.

Not matter you use the nerual network model or porgram, here we all call it Operation.

Like the classic problem to find out the picture does is it a cat, we focus on the cat picture as the input data, but in AGI, the input data
is not the main issue. every possible real world impact on you is a input data, and you will find out what it is.

My early philosophy thinking has developed a information_pack concept, I think human brain the core reasoning start point that it is to find out what it is about thing, to define the more abstract concept "one". 

Talking is a slice of complex brain activity in summary.

Studying english language we found the basic syntax:
- subject = subject_complement
- subject =>(verb) object

If every AGI model, it's data all will convert to a common data verctor space, let's assume it is build on english language, and going on simply it more and more 
until we can not. then we will find subject, seem more likely it is a conclusion, not a main issue. 

Here is some basic assumption:

1. every nerual cell is a unique basic operation.

2. when the real world impact on brain as input data, we brain must do some thing or operation that is we find something. the introspection process split by a tiny time slice. In this tiny time slice, brain do a lot of different operation, this different operation build up the step one talk about the basic operation.

3. operation output just two value, True or False. we call it the Attribute. such as eye move round by a circle and output True, we call this thing has attribute circle. but wait, until now we donot figure out which it is, the thing just the thing, the thing is not different with other thing, the thing here is just because our brain inner introspection process split by a tiny time splice.

4. finally the information_pack concept has came out. the InformationPack such as zhouyi 泰卦 or taigua is 

{Attribute: op1 True, Attribute op2 True, Attribute op3 True, Attribute op4 False, Attribute op5 False, Attribute op6 False}

or for a simple example... the information pack apple is:

{this thing is red, this thing is round....}


IMPORTANT NOTICE: the information pack name is unique which is handled by the AGI brain, that is saying even the AGI brain does not talk with us, he still can develop many information pack concept by himself.

## step two: talk with human
Every AGI brain has his own information pack system, which we called it unlabled information pack system. the second step is lable it by human hand? no, here is the fact, we all live in the same univese or same real world, so eventually every AGI brain information pack system going to some common state, we based on this common state and do some label work. here less some details, but here is my assumption: the step two turn out to be a very mature procedural in the future.

by the end of step two, the AGI brain can make some simply sound like: this is a apple, this is a chair etc...

of course we automaticly labled not the whole system, in the AGI brain whole life he still need to going on learning new lable.

## step three: keep learning

world data =>[program] => output

world data =>[model]  => output

with the deep learning technology, we will still do some extra work to train our AGI brain, but here is the fact:

1. we do not handly process data and feed into AGI brain, Let the world data directly impact the AGI brain.

2. maybe some AGI brain does not have the need to learn human language, maybe some cost issue?, but most AGI brain will learn at least one human language and some extra work make his own information pack system adjust by human language such as english language, then the future AGI brain trainning work will mostly some lable work, and this lable work will directly talk with it.
